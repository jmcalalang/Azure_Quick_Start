:todo:
# I have a problem swapping between deployments.
## this needs to be addressed before the helper sript
  - Network names are hardcoded
  - dns names for deployed instances
  - single nic port for mgmt is 8443, i think i can make this a variable...


FQDN for AS3
"members": [
 {
   "servicePort": 443,
   "addressDiscovery": "fqdn",
   "hostname": "www.google.com"
 }
]
